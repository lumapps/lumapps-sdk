The use case could be to use get a given template, fill it with your content and save it as a new content on your site. First step - get the template id \u00a4 After your created your content get's is content id. The id is in the url of your template https://your_instance/content/edit/6677628373958656?isTemplate=true Here our template id is 6677628373958656 This example as 2 rows with each one containing 2 columns. Second step - Get the template in python \u00a4 import copy from lumapps.api.base_client import BaseClient client = BaseClient ( token = \" {your_token} \" ) template_id = \" {your_template_id} \" template = client . get_call ( \"template/get\" , uid = template_id ) # We copy it to keep the original as is and maybe use it later to fill it with different content template_copy = copy . deepcopy ( template ) Now you have the template. A template is a big json object that can be seen as: Template => Components => Cells => Widgets or Template => Rows => Columns => Widgets So for instance if I want all the widgets of the first row and second column I do: first_row_second_column = template_copy [ 'components' ][ 0 ][ 'cells' ][ 1 ][ 'components' ] # Print the type of the widgets in that column for widget in first_row_second_column : print ( widget [ 'widgetType' ]) html user content-list Third step - modify the template in place \u00a4 Now that we have the content and know how it is layed out, replacing it should be easy. We just have to found where in each widget the content is and replace it. The thing is that some widgets have particularities and so the content is not always in the content key The content for an html is in the properties of each widget and it's a dictionnary with keys that are the language. first_row_second_column [ 0 ][ 'properties' ][ 'content' ] {'fr': ['<p> Modified button </p>']} Whereas the content for a user_list is a list of ids and its under the userIds key first_row_second_column [ 1 ][ 'properties' ][ 'usersIds' ] ['5993218790653952'] Another case is the content for a content list is a list of ids and its under the contents key first_row_second_column [ 2 ][ 'properties' ][ 'contents' ] ['5145730009006080'] So now let change something in the template first_row_second_column [ 0 ][ 'properties' ][ 'content' ][ 'fr' ] = '<p> Modified button </p>' So, now we can replace this content and so we'll have a template object filled with what we want. Fourth step - Save the template in a content \u00a4 The last step is to save the actual content, so we have to create the basic object for a content and add to it the filled template The only annoying step before is to get the ids of the feeds we restrict this content to.
